== README

I've tried to dockerize this

`docker-compose build` will build it
`docker-compose up` will bring it up
`docker-compose up --build` will build and bring it up
`docker-compose exec web rake db:migrate` will run the db:migrate

you'll probably need to delete the server.pid in the tmp directory and then run build 

I'm currently having an error in the embedded forms for encounters.  I can't quite figure out why there's not patient_id in the encounters
